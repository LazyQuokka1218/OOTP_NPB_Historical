<summary><b>Q: I want to change the league name or team names.</b></summary>

The default league name is "Major League Baseball" - you need to change it yourself.

**Warning:** Do NOT use "Nippon Professional Baseball" as the league name. OOTP will convert your league to a South African league if you do.

Use something like **"Japanese Professional Baseball"** or **"Japanese Probaseball League"** instead. The abbreviation "NPB" is fine to use.

Similarly, if 6 or more teams have identical names to current NPB teams, OOTP will also convert your league to a South African league. This mod uses **City + Nickname** format (e.g., "Tokyo Giants" instead of "Yomiuri Giants") to avoid this issue. We recommend keeping the team names as they are.

<summary><b>Q: Can I load both NPB and MLB at the same time?</b></summary>

Technically possible, but not recommended.

This NPB historical mod is built on top of the MLB historical database structure - think of it as an NPB skin over the MLB framework. You could load both databases from different paths and add them together, but you'd likely run into issues like duplicate players (guys who played in both leagues).

More importantly, NPB is set at the same level as MLB in this mod, which would create balance issues if you merged them.

This mod is meant to be played standalone.
